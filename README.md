# Nasa Wallpaper ðŸš€

A simple script to fetch the nasa picture of the day, save it and set it as your wallpaper if you want

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

## Setup

### Dependancies

I recomanded to use venv to setup a virtual environment to install required modules (![venv doc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html))

First create the virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

This will create a virtual environment in the `.venv` direcotry.

Then activate the virtual environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Now You can install the dependancies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment variables

copy the `.env.sample` file to a `.env` file and fill the requried variables

```
NASA_KEY="YOUR_NASA_API_KEY"
SET_WALLPAPER=1 # 1 for true, 0 for false
```

Get a nasa api key: [click here](https://api.nasa.gov/)

## Run

Execute this to run the script

```bash
python nasa-wallpaper.py
```

This will get the image from teh API, store it into a `pictures` directory and set it as your wallpaper depending on the value set in your environment.

## Features

- Get picture of the day
- Save picture

Set picture as wallpaper:

- Linux # Tested with ubuntu 22.04
- Linux: choose between dark and light theme
- Windows : TDOo
- Mac : TODO

## Cron

A nice setup for this script is to make it run each day, to do that on linux you can setup a cron job with the following steps

Frist open your cron tab with the command below

```bash
crontab -e
```

A file was open with your cron jobs, add the job for the nasa-wallpaper script by adding the following line

```bash
0 9 * * * DISPLAY=:1 XAUTHORITY=/run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority /home/user/nasa-wallpaper-repo/cron_exec.sh
```

Don't forget to replace the command to the path of the script on your machine

You can verify the value of `DISPLAY` and `XAUTHORITY` with the commands

```bash
echo $DISPLAY
echo $XAUTHORITY
```

The `0 9 * * *` in the line we added means that the job wil run every morning at 9.

If you have trouble with the cronjob I recommanded you to enable cron logs, see the following [article](https://cronitor.io/guides/no-mta-installed-discarding-output) to do it.
